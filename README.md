# AI-Driven Light Pollution Control ðŸŒŒ

This project presents an **AI-based framework** to monitor and predict **light pollution levels** using **drone-captured data**.  
By analyzing parameters such as **altitude, exposure time, and color intensity (RGB values)**, the system predicts **Night Sky Brightness (NSB)** to support smart lighting management and sustainable urban planning.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Predicts light pollution levels from drone data using ML models (e.g., LightGBM, XGBoost, RandomForest)
- Scalable integration with IoT sensors and smart lighting systems
- Real-time prediction app built using **Streamlit**
- Focus on sustainability and energy efficiency

## ðŸ§  Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Streamlit (for interactive dashboard)
- Joblib (for model deployment)
- Drone / IoT datasets for training and testing

## ðŸŒ± Goal
To reduce energy waste and restore natural night skies by enabling **data-driven light management** and **smart urban lighting control**.
