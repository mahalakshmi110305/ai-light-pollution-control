# ai-light-pollution-control
A machine learningâ€“powered system that uses drone-based data (altitude, exposure, RGB values, and luminance) to monitor and predict night sky brightness. The project combines AI models and IoT concepts to identify light pollution hotspots, optimize urban lighting, and promote environmental sustainability.
